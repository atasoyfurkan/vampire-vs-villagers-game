## Challenges

### Implementing DDOS
Our project included an additional challenge of generating a DDOS attack on the host that resulted in packet loss.(?) This task required generating and overloading the host with significant amount of packets. We managed to come up with a good solution using threads.
### Designing the network
Our game required a manager agent that would track the game state, handle action requests and notify the players accordingly. It also required a decentralized chatting system where user
### Testing
One of the most challenging part of this project was actually on testing it. Since the game has many moving parts, there were many edge cases during the testing. To solve these problems, we implemented our host script in a way that it produced messages (?). Also, since our gameflow required at least 4 participants, setting up the full testing environment was also problematic.
